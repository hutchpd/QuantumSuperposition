## Functional & LINQ Operations

## Required Namespaces

Make sure to import the correct namespaces for these examples.

```csharp
using System.Numerics;
using QuantumSuperposition.QuantumSoup;
using QuantumSuperposition.Core;
```

These features let you get playful with logic and structure without observation causing your fragile multiverse to unravel.

- `p_op`: Conditional without collapse. Schrödinger's choice logic.
- `p_func`: Functional state transforms. Map, filter, flatten without collapsing. LINQ for the superposed soul.
- Non observational arithmetic: enable operations like `+`, `*`, etc., without collapsing your `QuBit`. You get the maths and you keep the quantum soup.
- Weighted function composition: let probabilistic weights influence branching logic.
- Commutative optimisation: cache results of pure, commutative operations. Why recompute 2+3 when 3+2 already did the work?
- Monad compatible superpositions: LINQ style `.Select()`, `.Where()`, `.SelectMany()` with lazy evaluation that optimises performance.
