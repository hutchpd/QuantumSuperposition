## Functional & LINQ Operations

## Required Namespaces

 Make sure to import the correct namespaces, for these examples we use.

```csharp
using System.Numerics;
using QuantumSuperposition.QuantumSoup;
using QuantumSuperposition.Core;

These features let you get freaky with logic and structure — *without* observation causing your fragile multiverse to unravel.

- **`p_op` – Conditional Without Collapse**: Choose branches based on conditions without collapsing the state. Schrödinger's choice logic.
- **`p_func` – Functional State Transforms**: Map, filter, flatten — all without collapsing. LINQ for the superposed soul.
- **Non-Observational Arithmetic**: Enable operations like `+`, `*`, etc., without collapsing your QuBit. You get the math, *and* you keep the quantum soup. Have your waveform and eat it too.
- **Weighted Function Composition**: Let probabilistic weights affect how branching logic plays out. Now your uncertainty has influence.
- **Commutative Optimization**: Cache results of pure, commutative operations. Why recompute 2+3 when 3+2 already suffered that fate?
- **Monad-Compatible Superpositions**: LINQ-style `.Select()`, `.Where()`, `.SelectMany()` with lazy evaluation — the cool kind of lazy that optimizes performance, not just vibes.
